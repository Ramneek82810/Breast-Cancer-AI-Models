# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-EDA

Breast Cancer Classification and EDA
Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The aim is to analyze the features of the dataset, visualize relationships between them, and build a machine learning model to classify tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 569 samples of breast tumor data, with 30 features describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Project Structure
breast_cancer_classification.py: The main Python script for loading the dataset, performing EDA, and preparing the data for classification.
requirements.txt: A file containing the required Python packages to run the project.
Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the required libraries. Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python breast_cancer_classification.py
Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships between key features and the target variable using pair plots, scatter plots, and a heatmap.
Data Preprocessing: Prepares the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Model Preparation: Sets the foundation for training a machine learning model.
